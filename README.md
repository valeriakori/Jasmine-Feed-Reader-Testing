# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS Feeds. The idea of the project is to implement test cases to ensure that the application will notify developers of the application if new changes to the code drastically interfere with the way the application runs.


## Dependencies and Libraries

- JavaScript-based Testing Framework JASMINE
- jQuery 

## How to view the project

Download this repo using  `git clone https://github.com/valeriakori/Jasmine-Feed-Reader-Testing.git`, access the project folder in your CLI  and then run `start index.html`. If the file does not open in your browser you can view it by simply opening index.html in your browser


## What I learned during this project

This test required me to analyze an existing JavaScript application with AJAX and a Google API in order to write test. These test ensure a smooth development process for the future as well as a sustainable maintanance. In order to write the tests, I needed to fondly understand the DOM manipulation executed by the application.
